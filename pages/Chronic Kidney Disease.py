########## Body ##########

st.write("""
        **Chronic kidney disease**, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. 
        Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. 
        Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body. 
        In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. 
        You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced.
        Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause. 
        But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. 
        Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) 
        or a kidney transplant.

        - **Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications**. When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the package. Taking too many pain relievers for a long time could lead to kidney damage.
        - **Maintain a healthy weight**. If you're at a healthy weight, maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss.
        - **Don't smoke**. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop.
        - **Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help**. If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage.

        CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure.
        Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medicine and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 1 in 50 people with the condition.
        If you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease. This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attack and stroke.
        Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medicine can help reduce your risk of developing it.
