        The procedure must be followed exactly to achieve reliable results. Do not compare the strips with the 
        colour chart before dipping the strip into the urine.

        1. **Dip the strip** into the urine up to the test area for no more than two seconds.
        2. **Rest the edge of the strip** along the rim of the container to remove excess urine; at this time, do not make the test areas touch the rim of the container. Turn the strip on its side and touch the strip once on an absorbent cloth to remove any remaining urine; excess urine on the strip may cause an interaction of chemicals between two adjacent test pads, so that an incorrect result may be produced.
